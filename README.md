# CV Builder
An Assignment from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/cv-application)

*"In this project you will be using React to create a small CV application. This will build on many of the basic React concepts you've learned so far."*

## Objectives
1. Use create-react-app to initialize a new React project
2. Create sections for General Information, Educational Experience and Practical Experience
3. Include an Edit and Submit button for each section. The submit button should submit your form and display the value of your input fields in HTML elements. The edit button should re-display the input fields, with the previously displayed information as values. You should be able to edit and resubmit content

## Status - Complete!
Tasks remaining:
1. Add advanced styling
